# Business News Tagging Engine
#### Springboard Capstone Project  1 | James Flint | mail@jamesflint.net | 2017-08-31

## Requirement

Examine articles from a news database and tag them in accordance with a pre-existing heuristic editorial classification system.

## Client

Our client is business, technology and finance news company, Curation. Curation is currently paying a sizable team of journalists to select, summarise and tag news articles, an operation that is costly and non-scalable. The company would like to automate much of its editorial process, and reserve human intervention for editorial sign-off and original business insight instead of using it to perform relatively low-level text processing tasks. Several components are required in order to solve this problem. The first of these, to be addressed in this project, is to design a system capable of accurate semantic classification.

## Data

Curation has a clean, human-curated database of around 80,000 summarised news articles (JSON format). I have permission to use a subset of this as a training set. For raw source data, Iâ€™m using a sample of data from a standard news database (LexisNexus Moreover, format: XML). Please note: the data is proprietary, and is therefore NOT included in this repo.

## Approach
1.	Data Wrangling2.	Finding a Language Model3.	Conducting Similarity Queries4.	Topic Modelling5.	Automatic Classification
6. Conclusion & Next Steps7.	Further research

## Elements

* A 27-page project report in Microsoft Word* Executable Python code for the various modules of the project* A Jupyter notebook demonstrating implementation of the codebase* A client presentation in Microsoft Powerpoint
